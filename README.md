# Ajax Quick Checkout 7 (for Opencart  2.x & 3.x)

By [Dreamvention.ee](https://dreamvention.ee)

[DEMO](http://demo.shopunity.net/index.php?route=extension/demo&extension_download_id=79)

The default Opencart Checkout could lose up to 67% of sales just becuase its so damn long. Too many fields and steps to fullfil. With Ajax Quick Checkout you get to change that. 

AQC7 allows you to:
1. Edit everyything with Visual Editor
2. Hide and sort steps and fields
3. Add one or more pages to the checkout process
4. Extend the functionality with plugins
5. Pick ready made layouts and themes

This is just a small list of all the features. 

## Extend your checkout
You can extend the functionality of the AQC7 with plugins. You can find them on [Dreamvention.ee](https://dreamvention.ee) or create your own.
